# hx

A modern hiccup compiler, targeted at maximal React interop.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[hx.react :as hx])
(require '[react :as react])

(react/render
  (hx/compile
    $[:span {:style {:font-weight "bold"}} "Hello, world!"])
             
  (. js/document getElementById "app"))
```

## Goals

1. **Simple** interop between vanilla React features and CLJS code, to ease
   adoption of new features & technologies in the JS world.
   
2. **Performant** parsing of hiccup syntax; impact is minimized by using macros,
   to remove the need for runtime parsing of hiccup and minimize marshalling of
   CLJS data.
   
3. **Extensible** API so that parsing, analysis & code generation of the hiccup
   compiler can evolve to meet the needs of different ecosystems.
